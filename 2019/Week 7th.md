### [836. Rectangle Overlap](https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-overlap/)

#### Description

A rectangle is represented as a list `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`, where `(x1, y1)` are the coordinates of its bottom-left corner, and `(x2, y2)` are the coordinates of its top-right corner.  

Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.  

Given two (axis-aligned) rectangles, return whether they overlap.  

#### Example 1

```javascript
Input: rec1 = [0, 0, 2, 2], rec2 = [1, 1, 3, 3]
Output: true
```

#### Example 2

```javascript
Input: rec1 = [0, 0, 1, 1] rect2 = [1, 0, 2, 1]
Output: false
```

#### Notes

1. Both rectangles `rec1` and `rec2` are list of 4 integers.
2. All coordinates in rectangles will be between `-10^9` and `10^9`.

#### Solution with 1D

```javascript
/**
 * 1D solution for two rectangles overlap judgement.
 * Consider a 1D overlap (Interval problem).
 * For an overlap to occur necessary condition is
 *  
 *         x3,y2             x4,y2
 *          |-----------------|
 * |-----------------|
 * x1,y1            x2,y1
 *  
 * x1 < x3 < x2 && x3 < x2 < x4
 *  
 * Or simplified - x1 < x4 && x3 < x2
 * For 2D case use 1D conditions for both X and Y axes
 *  
 * Case-1: Rec2 intersects with Rec1 on **top right** corner

## Review

[Developments in Web Components Iâ€™m excited about in 2019](https://medium.com/dailyjs/developments-in-web-components-im-excited-about-in-2019-3ae7751c2f64)  

Frontend development work flow may be changed again. JavaScript is changing, HTML is changing, CSS is changing. every for us is changing, We shape these languages, these languages shape our industry.

## Technique

Find the key that hold the specific value.  

```javascript
/**
 * Returns the first key that statisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise `undefined` is returned.
 *  
 * Use `Object.keys(obj)` to get all the properties of the object, 
 * `Array.prototype.find()` to test the provided function for each key-value pair.
 * The callback receives three arguments - the value, the key and object.
 * @param {Object} obj
 * @param {Function} fn
 * @returns {String}
 */
const findKey = (obj, fn) => Object.keys(obj).find(key => fn(obj[key], key, obj));

const obj = {
  barney: { age: 36, active: true },
  fred: { age: 40, active: false },
  pebbles: { age: 1, active: true }
};

const fn = o => o['active'];
const key = findKey(obj, fn);
console.log(key); // barney
```

Computer science to me is the life long course, I have to insist, sometimes I may be lazy, but I always know how to come back to the course.
